// Sequence is a KSUID generator which produces a sequence of ordered KSUIDs
// from a seed.
//
// Up to 65536 KSUIDs can be generated by for a single seed.
//
// A typical usage of a Sequence looks like this:
//
//	seq := ksuid.Sequence{
//		Seed: ksuid.New(),
//	}
//	id, err := seq.Next()
//
// Sequence values are not safe to use concurrently from multiple goroutines.

	// The seed is used as base for the KSUID generator, all generated KSUIDs
	// share the same leading 18 bytes of the seed.
	Seed  KSUID
	count uint32 // uint32 for overflow, only 2 bytes are used
}

// Next produces the next KSUID in the sequence, or returns an error if the
// sequence has been exhausted.
